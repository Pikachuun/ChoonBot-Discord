#ChoonBot
it's a feature™

This is a bot I made for Discord. It has no purpose whatsoever but kinda became a thing.
Heck, it's even married to another person, apparently. And it even reproduced somehow????????

Here's a directory of files you should know about
- choonbot.js
⋅⋅⋅ The main bot file, and what you run in node in order to launch the bot.
- config-base.js
⋅⋅⋅ The bot's configuration file. You need to copy this to `config.js` and fill in the blanks in order to run the bot.
- fs/
⋅⋅- avatars/
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅ Where the avatars the bot can use are stored.
⋅⋅- emotes/
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅ Where the emotes the bot can use are stored.
⋅⋅- msg.js
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅ Where the bot's message parsing stuff is stored, such as commands and the like.
⋅⋅- txt/
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅ Where miscellaneous text files used for storing information are stored.
- node_modules/
⋅⋅⋅ Without these here heroku will cry. It's basically discord.js
- package.json
⋅⋅⋅ I think this is obvious if you've ever made one of these
- Procfile
⋅⋅⋅ See package.json
- README.md
⋅⋅⋅ The thing you're reading right now.

Note that my bot is really snarky so you should keep this in mind!
